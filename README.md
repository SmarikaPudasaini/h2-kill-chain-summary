# h2-kill-chain-summary
Kill chain is a module that describe the various steps or process that haker or attacker follow to attack or break chain so that s/he can get access and steal valuable information or disrupt the system, money and many other important things (Crowm jewels). Reconnaissance Exploitations, Weponization, Actions on objects are commom stages used in here.

## Various defination with example

1. Tactic- The goal or objective of the opponent during an attack which describe why attack being performed.
For example: Credential attack where adversary goal is to steal account names and passwords.

2. Technique - It describe how any of the attacker accomplishes the goal.
Example: Brute (trying multiple passwords to get access account)

3. Sub-technique - More specific variation of a technique.
Example : Guessing password ( sub-technique of Brute force where the attacker tries common or likely passwords.)

4. Procedure - The axact implementation of a technique in a real world attack which haker actually do.
For Example: Using tools like Hydra

### MY QUESTIONS

1. How can organizations can balance between openness (for strong defence) and secrecy (to avoid exposing their own vulnerabilities?)

2. What limits exists in making defence towards a predictive model such as weather forcating ?
